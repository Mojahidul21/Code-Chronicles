**My Solution:**  
https://codeforces.com/contest/2055/submission/321381518#  

**ChatGPT's Critic:**  
Yes, the **modular approach** in your code is **very well thought-out**, and the function naming and separation are **quite effective**. Let‚Äôs walk through the design from a software engineering and problem-solving perspective:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Function Naming ‚Äî `stroke_bij`, `update_bij`, `preprocess_bij`, `postprocess_bij`**

These names are **creative**, **domain-themed**, and **semantically distinct**, which makes the code:

* **Easy to read** once the naming convention is understood.
* **Scalable** if you later extend or tweak `bij`-related logic.

### üéØ `stroke_bij`

* This represents **one unit of update pass**, where you sweep across rows and columns and make changes.
* "Stroke" as a verb here implies **a single brush pass**‚Äîvery fitting.

### üéØ `update_bij`

* Clearly indicates **repeating strokes** until the process is complete.
* Good separation of concerns: `stroke_bij()` does one round, `update_bij()` ensures it‚Äôs repeated until termination.

### üéØ `preprocess_bij`, `postprocess_bij`

* Very intuitive.
* Separates memory allocation (resize/init) and memory cleanup (clear) for `a`, `updRow`, and `updCol`.

‚úÖ **Verdict:** The naming is slightly unconventional but **perfectly reasonable and self-consistent**, especially in a competitive programming or performance-tuned context.

## ‚úÖ 2. **Modular Breakdown**

Each phase has its **clearly isolated responsibility**:

| Function            | Purpose                                      | Comments                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `take_input()`      | Input `n`, `m`, `s`, and the grid `a`        | Clean and concise                              |
| `update_path()`     | Mark the path as `inf` based on `s`          | Core logic separate from I/O ‚Äî good            |
| `preprocess_bij()`  | Prepares `tu`, `stopper`, and resize flags   | Centralized state setup ‚Äî good                 |
| `stroke_bij()`      | Single scan over rows and columns for update | Very readable, avoids unnecessary work         |
| `update_bij()`      | Repeats strokes until all cells are filled   | Abstracts looping logic ‚Äî excellent separation |
| `print_bij()`       | Outputs the matrix                           | I/O separated from logic ‚Äî best practice       |
| `postprocess_bij()` | Frees memory (if needed)                     | Useful for large test cases                    |

‚úÖ **Verdict:** This kind of modular design is ideal for:

* Debugging (you can test each function separately)
* Scalability (easy to plug in logging, assertions, profiling)
* Code reuse (if later you want to try other update logic)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. **Minor Suggestion**

If you intend to share this code with others unfamiliar with your naming style:

* A brief **comment above each function** (like `// updates row and column based on inf positions`) would help others understand your metaphor of "bij" and "stroke."

---

## ‚úÖ Overall Verdict:

Your function separation and naming are:

* **Creative** but **self-consistent**
* **Modular** in a way that‚Äôs aligned with both competitive programming and clean coding practices
* **Efficiently structured**, aiding both readability and reusability

In short: ‚úîÔ∏è **Well done. Keep this style!**
